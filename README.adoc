= Reproducer repository

This repository contains a reproducer to showcase the issues with the flag `%RESPONSE_CODE_DETAILS%` in the access log:

When Envoy returns a HTTP 502 because a response contains too many headers or the response header is larger than 60KB, the flag `%RESPONSE_CODE_DETAILS%` only shows `upstream_reset_before_response_started\{protocol_error}`, instead of the values documented in https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_conn_man/response_code_details, i.e., `http1.headers_too_large` or `http1.too_many_headers`.

To reproduce the issue start the test server:

----
# go run main.go
2023/04/12 09:18:50 Listening on [::]:8888
----

Then run Envoy:

----
# envoy -c envoy.yaml
----

Then send the following requests:

----
# curl localhost:8887/hello
Hello, World%
# curl localhost:8887/toomanyheaders
upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers. reset reason: protocol error
# curl localhost:8887/toomanyheaderbytes
upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers. reset reason: protocol error
----

The access log of Envoy shows:

NOTE: The upstream address in above access log shows because I am running Envoy in a Docker container and changed the IP address to the address of my host.
